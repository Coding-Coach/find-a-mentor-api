### Running the app in a container
The following command can be used to run both, the api and the database, in
separate containers (e.g. if you don't have node on your machine):
```bash
# start both containers
$ docker-compose up

# use ctrl-c to stop both containers
```

## Running the app
The following steps can be used to run the database in a container and the
api locally:
```bash
# start mongo DB in a container in the background
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-db.yml up -d

# development
$ yarn start

# development in watch mode
$ yarn start:dev

```
