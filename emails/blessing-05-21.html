<p>Hey Mentors!</p>
<p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  It's been a while, but we're excited to reach out to you today. We want to
  thank you all for being part of CodingCoach and helping the members of our
  community take that next step on the journey to becoming a software developer
  or advancing their career.
</p>

<p>
  We're always thinking of ways to improve the experience for both mentors and
  mentees. For example, it's sometimes difficult to remember who's asked us to
  be their mentor. Every mentee introduces themselves in different way across a
  variety of channels since there isn't a formal way to make this connection on
  the CodingCoach platform. Did they ask me on Slack? Twitter? Email? I can't
  remember.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  Soon we'll be launching new functionality that allows mentors and mentees to
  establish a connection using the codingCoach platform directly. Prospective
  mentees will now submit a mentorship request to you using in-app tools. You'll
  receive an email as well as seeing a new request after you log in. Once you
  review the request – and either accept or decline the request (be nice) – the
  mentee will be informed of your decision and the request will be closed.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  Once you approve, we'll send an email to the mentee and only then, they will
  see your channels. If you decline their request, they won't see your contact
  information. With this change, both sides of the mentorship request will have
  a better understanding of what's happening, which will lead to a better
  outcome for everyone.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  We really appreciate every mentor in CodingCoach! We want to remind you that
  if you're no longer available to take mentees, please set yourself as
  inactive.
</p>

  If something is not working as expected or you have great ideas about this
  process or others, please let us know or create an issue or discussion in our
  GitHub organization.
